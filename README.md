# test_algo_visualizer
Test_Algorithm Visulizer(alpha)


This is a project that aims to provide visualizations of various algorithms. The goal of this project is to help students and professionals alike to better understand how different algorithms work by providing interactive visualizations that demonstrate the inner workings of these algorithms.

Getting Started

To use this project, simply clone the repository to your local machine and open the index.html file in your browser. From there, you can select the algorithm you would like to visualize and interact with the visualization to better understand how the algorithm works.

Algorithms
This project currently provides visualizations for the following algorithms:

Binary Search

Bubble Sort

Quick Sort

Merge Sort

Dijkstra's Algorithm



Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this project, you can fork the repository and make changes to the code as you see fit. Once you've made your changes, submit a pull request and we'll review your changes and potentially merge them into the main branch.
